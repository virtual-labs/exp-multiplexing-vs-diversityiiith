To analyze the tradeoff between spatial multiplexing and diversity gain in a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system, please follow the following steps :
  1) Enter the input values.
  2) The system automatically assigns the remaining antennas for diversity (in the case of fixed multiplexing) and for multiplexing (in the case of fixed diversity).
  3) Repeat the experiment with different values of and analyze the changes in multiplexing and diversity.
     
      3.1) If r increases, diversity d decreases, reducing resilience to fading.

      3.2) If r decreases, diversity d increases, improving reliability.
