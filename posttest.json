      "question": "What does the diversity-multiplexing trade-off in MIMO systems represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Trade-off between bandwidth and transmission distance",
        "b": "Trade-off between data rate and probability of error",
        "c": "Trade-off between modulation scheme and coding rate",
        "d": "Trade-off between transmission power and receiver sensitivity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Please try again.. diversity increases reliability and multiplexing increases the number of parallel data streams available",
