      "question": "Which of the following sentences correctly describes the difference between multiplexing and diversity? ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Diversity increases data rate by transmitting multiple data streams simultaneously.",
        "b": "Multiplexing improves reliability by using multiple antennas to mitigate fading effects.",
        "c": "Diversity enhances reliability through spatial, temporal, or frequency techniques.",
        "d": "Multiplexing mitigates fading effects by utilizing independent fading paths between antennas."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Please try again.. Multiplexing increases the data rate by sending parallel streams of data",
        "b": "Please try again.. Diversity improves reliability by using multiple antennas to mitigate fading effects.",
        "c": "Correct!",

      "question": "What happens to the number of SISO channels when antennas are grouped for diversity?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It increases",
        "b": "It remains same",
        "c": "It decreases",
        "d": "It becomes zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Please try again.. note that number of SISO channels depends on the number of individual available antennas",
        "b": "Please try again.. note that number of SISO channels depends on the number of individual available antennas",
        "c": "Correct!",
